## Who Did What?

I helped with writing the code and testing to make sure it ran, debugging and adjusting the libraries in the venv. Jennifer helped with the GIT commits and ensuring the file was uploaded to the correct branch. 

## What you learned

I got to learn about how to properly use command line to make commits to branches in Github, and also how to work with very niche libraries with specific instructions and documentation.
